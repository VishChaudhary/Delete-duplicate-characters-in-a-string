# Delete-duplicate-characters-in-a-string
C code that checks a string for repeating characters and deletes them if they occur.

A function takes two string arguments - StringOrig and StringMod as input. It then modifies StringOrig by removing any duplicate characters. For example, the string halloween will change to halowen and the string crossword will change to croswrd. The modified string is then placed in StringMod. The function is then tested by calling it from the main program.
